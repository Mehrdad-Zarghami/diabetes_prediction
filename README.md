# diabetes_prediction
A binary classification task for diabetes prediction   
A healthcare provider is interested in using machine learning to identify patients who are at high risk of developing diabetes. By identifying patients at risk, the healthcare provider can proactively intervene with preventive measures such as lifestyle interventions, medication, or referral to a specialist.   
The manager of the organisation has access to data collected from electronic medical records. In the first part of your assignment, you are asked to write a detailed proposal for a pilot study to investigate whether machine learning procedures could be used to successfully solve this problem.   

Prediction on a hold-out test set. An additional dataset, CE802_P2_Test.csv. Binary outcomes are withheld for this test set (i.e. the “Class” column is empty). In this second task you are required to produce class predictions of the records in the test set using one approach of your choice among those tested in task “a” (for example the one achieving the best performance). These data must not be used other than to test the algorithm trained on the training data.
