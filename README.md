A binary classification task for diabetes prediction   
A healthcare provider is interested in using machine learning to identify patients who are at high risk of developing diabetes. By identifying patients at risk, the healthcare provider can proactively intervene with preventive measures such as lifestyle interventions, medication, or referral to a specialist.   
The manager of the organisation has access to data collected from electronic medical records. In the first part of your assignment, you are asked to write a detailed proposal for a pilot study to investigate whether machine learning procedures could be used to successfully solve this problem.
